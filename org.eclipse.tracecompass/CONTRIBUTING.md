# Contributing to Eclipse Trace Compass

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse Trace Compassâ„¢ is an open source application to solve performance and
reliability issues by reading and analyzing logs or traces of a system. Its goal
is to provide views, graphs, metrics, and more to help extract useful
information from traces, in a way that is more user-friendly and informative
than huge text dumps.
